Hủ tiếu hồng phát noodles symbolise the culinary marriage of Choazhu and Khmer culture that was introduced to Saigon in the 1970s. Friendly service is de rigueur at this simple shop, which offers all-day dining but where locals particularly flock for breakfast. The soft rice noodle soup comes with minced meat, liver, fresh tiger shrimps or braised blood curd accompanied by an assortment of herbs and bean sprouts. The chả giò tôm cua (shrimp and crab spring rolls) make a great appetiser.

After walking down a narrow street, diners are invariably enchanted by the pretty lights that set the scene in the tranquil bamboo garden. The interior is equally atmospheric. Championing a cuisine without boundaries, the young chef curates a tasting menu of 7 or 9 courses that tells a story. She uses mostly local ingredients in her ingenious creations and changes the menu every four months to keep it fresh. Ask about the wine pairing option.

Xôi – steamed sticky rice – is a Vietnamese staple popularly eaten as a quick breakfast or lunch. Determined to shatter the stereotype of xôi as a frugal fast food, in 2021 a young team opened Xôi Bát, a charming little eatery with a contemporary design and great attention paid to detail. They put their recipe for a relatively soft sticky rice into dishes such as xôi phá lấu trứng non, which includes quail eggs, pig ears and fried shallots, and is served with soup and kimchi as a simple, appetising meal.

Mama Dung started out in the northern city of Nam Dinh in 1986, armed with her grandmother's recipe for a light, clean, pure broth. Now, in this shop, diners choose between a three-day beef-bone stock or chicken broth; stand-out dishes include the phở bắp hoa, featuring crunchy medium-rare beef, and Mama Dung's gà tôm mắm sốt (crispy fried chicken). There is also phở tine – a creative Western-style take on phở, served with golden French fries, beef noodle soup and cheese.

Bờm
24 Nguyen Thi Nghia Street, Ben Thanh Ward, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
Bờm's ambience and cuisine conjure up a fairy tale-like nostalgia for Vietnamese diners. In a chic, low-lit venue combining traditional bamboo with minimalist cement elements, the modern, refined Vietnamese cuisine ticks all the boxes. Try the bò kho tart – tender braised beef encased in flaky puff pastry – and the signature Bờm Set, comprising bite-size shrimp fritters, snail cakes and fish cakes. Mè đen, a mochi with a black sesame filling, provides a sweet finale.

Esta
27 Tran Quy Khoach, Tan Dinh Ward, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City, 700000, Vietnam
Chef Francis Thuan worked as a head chef in Saigon before co-founding and opening Esta in 2019. The menu is depicted by spot-on fusion Asian cuisine, influenced by trips to Japan, Korea and China and the chef’s Vietnamese roots. The theatrically visible kitchen showcases his culinary wizardry, founded on high-quality ingredients. Esta believes in sourcing vegetables from independent farmers and fish caught by small boats.

Phở Lệ (District 5)
413-415 Nguyen Trai, Ward 7, District 5, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking
Small Shop
Vietnam’s national noodle soup dish has taken the culinary world by storm, and Phở Lệ, one of the leading restaurants in town, insists on making it exactly the same way they have been doing for over 70 years. Come here for authentic southern Vietnamese style phở – in rich broth with a robust meaty flavour and a hint of sweetness from vegetables. Despite its age, the stall is neat and clean, and always jam-packed with hungry locals getting their noodle fix.

Octo
2F, 75 Ho Tung Mau Street, Ben Nghe Ward, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
With bare brick walls, a wood-clad high ceiling and black metal accents, the interior is the epitome of faux-industrial. Drenched in sunlight during the day, it is moodily lit at night. Either way, it has a real buzz that makes for a fun visit. Octo, which bills itself as a tapas restobar, is ideal for Spanish tapas, like their famous traditional croquettes, gazpacho and 48-month Iberico ham, washed down with a round of drinks.
